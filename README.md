# Advanced quiz app!

recently, I have realized that you can be more familiar with JavaScript by creating advanced games, or some big apps (like this one). but these small tutorials which are everywhere on the internet won't help so much. So I decided to srart this advanced journey.


## ðŸ“Œ Features

- User can choose number of questions, category, and more stuff...
- Timer with seconds "chosen by the user" and progress animation for every question
- Responsive
- Nice UI
- Display user's score with something special if they got the full mark 


## ðŸ’» Lessons Learned

The JS code with difficult for me at the beginning, as I goes on it started to be more clear. I tried as possible to make it readable and organised. I also have added comments to explain the functionality of every section of it.
